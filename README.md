# Cakery Website Project

This front-end project was completed as part of the IT extension course at Lexicon Malm√∂.

## Project Goals
The primary objective was to create a website using HTML and CSS. Additionally, I included some JavaScript code to streamline the process of adding content, even though it wasn't strictly necessary.

## Images
The majority of the images used in this project were sourced from pexels.com. A few of them are from the original website upon which this project is based.
